		<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of built heritage out there. We want to help you find the bits local to you.</p>
		<p>The population of Ireland is increasingly becoming more urban, with some 60% of us now living in urban areas. 
			There is a significant variety of built heritage scattered throughout the country ranging from cairns to megolitic tombs to old mills.
		</p>
		<p>A lot of this lay's hidden away from view in many different documents that many care not to read nor know of save those in the professions of spatial planning or heritage conservation.</p>
